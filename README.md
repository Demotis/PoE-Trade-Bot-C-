PoE - Trade Bot for Path of Exile

### Features
- Listen a chat and store customers;

- Offers / accepts an exchange offer;
- Counts and checks the price at the exchange rate (chaos equivalent from 3rd party api);

Bot will work only with HD resolution (1366x768), 'cause this is resolution of my notebook.

I think can add a list of resolutions as constants or choose one.
